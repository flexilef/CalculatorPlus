What is Calculator+?

Calculator+ is a simple-to-use, button-free, scientific calculator. It features a minimalistic design, consisting of one text field for input and one display screen for output in order to avoid the clunkiness that comes with buttons. Although simple in design, it is powerful enough to compute traditional operations as well as a variety of logarithmic, trigonometric, and exponential functions. Calculator+ also supports constants such as "PI" as well as your own custom-named variables. In addition, built in commands such as "?radians" (to turn on radians mode) are provided to really give you a convenient and mouse-free experience.
